        <h1>2. Description of Independent Teaching Experience</h1>
        <a href="index.html">Back to Content</a>
        <p>During my time at Syracuse University, I have undertaken significant teaching responsibilities in both classroom and individual settings, which have allowed me to develop and demonstrate autonomy, pedagogical skills, and a deep understanding of music theory and composition. My teaching experience includes:</p>
        <h2>Classroom Instruction in MTC 245 (Chromatic Harmony I) and MTC 246 (Chromatic Harmony II):</h2>
        <p>I independently designed and delivered lectures on advanced topics in music theory, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing Ternary Piano Pieces: This involved teaching students how to analyze and compose ternary-form piano pieces, with a focus on structural analysis, harmonic progression, and thematic development. I also incorporated music appreciation components to help students understand the historical and stylistic context of the works.</li>
            <li>Underset Theory through the Music of Alexander Scriabin and Karol Szymanowski: I introduced students to advanced theoretical concepts such as pitch-class sets and their application in the analysis of early 20th-century music. This required students to engage critically with complex harmonic structures and develop analytical skills applicable to modernist compositions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Individual Theory Lessons:</h2>
        <p>I conducted one-on-one lessons with students, tailoring instruction to their specific needs and interests. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lessons on Baroque to 20th-Century Composers: I taught students how to analyze and interpret music from a wide range of historical periods, including works by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann, Chopin, Liszt, Saint-Säens, Debussy, and Schönberg. These lessons emphasized historical context, theoretical frameworks, and performance practice.</li>
            <li>Lesson with Danni Huang on Arnold Schoenberg’s Early Music: I guided the student through an in-depth analysis of Schoenberg’s early atonal works, focusing on harmonic language, formal structure, and the transition from tonality to atonality. This lesson required me to adapt my teaching methods to the student’s learning style and provide personalized feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Autonomy and Responsibility:</h2>
        <p>In both classroom and individual settings, I took full responsibility for planning lessons, developing teaching materials (e.g., handouts, assignments, and exams), and assessing student work. I also provided detailed feedback to students to help them improve their analytical and compositional skills.
            I managed classroom dynamics, facilitated discussions, and ensured that students were actively engaged in the learning process. My teaching approach emphasized critical thinking, creativity, and the application of theoretical concepts to practical musical contexts.</p>
        <h2>Mentored Guidance:</h2>
        <p>Throughout my teaching experiences, I worked closely with faculty mentors to refine my teaching methods and reflect on my pedagogical practices. I sought feedback on my lesson plans, teaching materials, and classroom performance, and incorporated this feedback to improve my effectiveness as an instructor.</p>
        <p>This teaching experience has allowed me to develop a comprehensive understanding of the responsibilities and challenges of faculty-level teaching, including course design, student engagement, and assessment. It has also prepared me to meet the expectations of a faculty role in higher education, particularly in the areas of music theory and composition.</p>
