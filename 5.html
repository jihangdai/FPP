        <h2>My Philosophy in Regards of Teaching Music in General</h2>
        <p>I believe that all of the subdisciplines of music – music theory, music history, composition, performance, conducting, etc., are all closely related. They all belong to the same discipline: music. Therefore, in education, they should not be separated. For practical matters, in real school-based education, these things are taught in different courses. However, I believe that it is essential for a qualified music educator to bridge these gaps between these disciplines. For instance, concepts learned in theory will affect a student’s performance, and learning to compose will enhance a student’s theory skills, etc.</p>
        <p>Another crucial thing when it comes to music education is listening. Music is supposed to be listened to by people, and music education should be centered around this aspect. The educator should invite students to listen to a lot of recordings so that the student is deeply immersed in the style of music that they are studying. In the context of music theory pedagogy, this is a more serious issue, since a lot of times the students are merely doing exercises on paper instead of actively listening to the music they are studying. A good educator should be able to resolve this issue.</p>
        <h2>My Thoughts on Teaching Theory</h2>
        <p>Music theory is very beneficial to students in general. Some performance students are having difficulty with their pieces, not because they have technical issues, but because they fail to understand the music from a theoretical perspective. They may find the form confusing that they couldn’t have a good grasp on it, or they may find the harmony confusing that they couldn’t find the notes. In these situations, simply practicing more is not going to help. The student also needs to learn music theory and analyze the music that the student is performing.</p>
        <p>However, a lot of times, the students feel alienated by theory courses, thinking that it’s useless. Both their major teachers and theory teachers should address this confusion. The major teachers should invite the students to understand the music from a theoretical perspective, instead of merely practicing it from a technical perspective. The theory teacher should also relate the material to performance practices and related issues. In an one-on-one setting, the theory teacher should address theoretical aspects of the student’s repertoire.</p>
        <p>Composition is another important aspect of music education, and should be included in theory courses to maximize the outcome. Noticing how the theoretical concepts work in other pieces is different from utilizing the concepts yourself. One should practice their understanding of theoretical concepts by writing some pieces using those concepts. Therefore, the students can better understand those concepts and begin to appreciate the pieces studied in class at a deeper level.</p>
